# The Idea

I will build a gem that will provide the user with a Word of the Day along with the definition, example use cases, and pronunciation. The gem will have a CLI that will allow the user to view past Words of the Day.

## The Plan
1. Plan the Gem. Imagine the CLI
2. Start with the project structure. I used Bundler.
3. Start with the entry point - the file run
4. Force that.

### Behavior
I'd like the app to start with: 
1. `greeting` the user.
2. Display the word of day `wod` with full attributes i.e date, definition, example use cases, and pronunciation. (Pronunciation should be clickable to listen to the audio clip.)
3. Ask the user for input.
