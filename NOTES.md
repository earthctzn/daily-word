# The Idea

I will build an gem that will provide the user with a Word of the Day along with the definition, example use cases, and pronunciation. The gem will have a CLI that will allow the user to view past Words of the Day.

## The Plan

I'd like the app to start with: 
1. `greeting` the user.
2. Displaying the word of day `wod` with full attributes i.e date, definition, example use cases, and pronunciation. (Pronunciation should be clickable to listen to the audio clip.)
3. Ask the user "Would you like to see more Words of the Day?
